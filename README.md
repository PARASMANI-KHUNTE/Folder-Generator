# Folder-Generator
 Automate folder creation from text file topics. Organize projects efficiently. Simplify file management.

Topic Folder Creator
This Python script reads a text file containing topics and creates folders based on each topic. Each line in the text file represents a separate topic, and a folder is created for each topic.

Usage
Install Python:
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from python.org.
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/topic-folder-creator.git
Navigate to the Directory:
bash
Copy code
cd topic-folder-creator
Prepare the Text File:
Create a text file named topics.txt in the same directory as the script.
Add each topic on a separate line in the text file.
Run the Script:
bash
Copy code
python create_folders_from_file.py
Follow the prompts to specify the name of the main folder where the topic folders will be created.
View the Result:
Once the script completes execution, check the specified main folder to find the created topic folders.
Example
Suppose topics.txt contains the following topics:

Copy code
Python
JavaScript
Machine Learning

Running the script and specifying the main folder as MainFolder will create the following folder structure:
